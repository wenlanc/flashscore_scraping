First, install Google Chrome for Debian/Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install libxss1 libappindicator1 libindicator7
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb

Now, letâ€™s install xvfb so we can run Chrome headlessly:

sudo apt-get install xvfb
